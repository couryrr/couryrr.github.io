# Why Bother Blogging

## A bit about me

To be frank I am not a great writer. I have a hard time with grammar, my sentence structure is kind of all over the place and I tend to meander. Apparently, I am also not a great salesman either. However, I enjoy writing. It is something I could, and probably should, work on. I enjoy digging into topic and getting to the core of an idea. I think it is worthwhile to capture that.

## But why blog

Now might seem like a bleak time to start. "AI" is taking over the internet. Creating more slop then we even know what to do with. Sucking up all of the free and not so free knowledge that mankind strove to curate. Making scammer lives easier and making it appear that the Dead Internet theory is real.

If things are as I assert above why blog? Because I can. But some more refined thoughts.

As mentioned above I enjoying writing and should work on it. Normally, I just scribble thought here and there. Maybe make a readme for my repo or notes. I never take the time to slow down and fully enjoy the craft of writing. Arguably writing is one of the most important skills in all of mankind. So blogging is my attempt at honing this skill. Adding some structure to the madness, brush up on grammar and just be better at capturing my thoughts in text to share.

It is critical that we share thought and experiences. The many literature works that exist, science journal, mathematics, everything is created by sharing. All of those works together eventually culminate to knowledge for all of us. If we do not work toward furthering our knowledge then we cannot be called homo-sapience.

Taking time to reflect. Too often I just consume a media think “wow that is interesting” and then poof it is gone. I mean not totally gone my memory is fine. I just want to make sure there is some effort behind what I read, listened to, or watched. Should I research more? Is it worth exploring deeper? Even if it is just for myself having a more structured journal of my thoughts feels like a good idea. Even better if it sparks someone else.

The only way we keep the web is by making it ours. Sure "AI" is all the craze. It is like a black-hole of money and knowledge. How can we fight it? Keep being better than it. We all know when art or text is generated. Lets not throw up our hands and call it defeat. Don’t let that slop consume the internet. Keep doing exactly what we have been doing for decades. The effort and passion a person puts into an endeavour impacts them and the people that interact with it. Which I think is worth it.

## My Goals

While I get my footing I want to do a post a month. Well written and referenced. My topics will be varied but geared toward tech. No hot takes. Just some good old research.

Keep my sanity about the web. There is a lot of trash out there we really do not need. I want to add to the better parts.

## End note

The astute among you may have notice the quotes around "AI". That is because we should call it what it is. Machine learning or ML which to be fair is so so so incredibly fascinating. Artificial Intelligence may come using ML but a ChatBot/LLM is so pretty far from that.
